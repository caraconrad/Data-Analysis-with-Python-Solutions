Data Analysis with Python Solutions
==============

This is a copy of my solutions to the Data Analysis with Python certificate from freecodecamp.org. My originals can be found here: https://replit.com/@CaraConrad

This course has a series of five data science projects that incorporate Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
As this was my introduction to data science I found this certificate to be quite challenging even though I had a lot of Python experience going into it.

I found this to be very challenging and rewarding and would love to do more data science projects at some point.
I highly recommend this for all programmers whether you intend on doing more with data science or not.
